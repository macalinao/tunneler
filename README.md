# tunneler

A 3D adventure game that puts you to sleep.

It's my first game with LibGDX. I am currently making this game to learn LibGDX and Android.

## Building

This game uses Maven. You can run `mvn -Pdesktop package` to create a JAR.

## License

This code is under the MIT license, which can be found on Google.
